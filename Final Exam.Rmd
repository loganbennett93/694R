## Data

For this analysis, a dataset is provided from responses of individuals to the National Household Travel Survey. I must first load the data and format it in a way that I can do choice modeling.

```{r data setup}
# load dap object into workspace
dap <- read_rds(url("https://github.com/byu-transpolab/wheelchair_cdap2/raw/master/data/person_dap.rds"))
# show first ten rows of data
dap
#Convert data into a choice modeling dataset
choice_data <- dfidx(dap, choice = "dap2", idnames = "id", shape = "wide")
```
